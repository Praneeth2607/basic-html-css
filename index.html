          <h2>Mayapur Clean & Green Team Launches Second-Hand Shop to Promote Sustainability</h2>
          <p>
            The Mayapur Clean and Green Team, led by Murari Mohini Devi Dasi, has initiated a second-hand recycling store to foster environmental sustainability in the Mayapur community.
